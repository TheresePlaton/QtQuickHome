# QtQuickHome

Testing capabilities of QT. In this project I have followed a Youtube tutorial from QT, where they used labs.
Here  I have used qtquick 2.7.
This is a basic userinterface for a Smart Home.
Making custom components is easy. without any effort you can get swipe functionality.
Truly amazing tool
